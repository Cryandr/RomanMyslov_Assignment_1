## Description

This website allows the customer to view the firm's range of products and services, view photographs or images of the products, and view pricing information for the products. Customers can shop online using a variety of computers and devices, including desktops and laptops as well.

1. Home (index.html)
 
The first page or starting point of navigation that gives visitors the first impression. It provides a header, footer, UCLan logo, text and video content as an embedded YouTube iFrame, as well as tags used to link from one page to another.
 
2. Products (products.html)

Provides access to all products (T-shirts, hoodies and jumpers). The customer can view the product image, read the product description and view the product price information. Using sessionStorage, the page provides a feature that allows you to click on "More Details" for more information. And using localStorage, the page also allows users to add items to the cart.
 
3. Cart (cart.html)
 
When using localStorage, the page provides functionality for viewing a shopping cart with added items. The buyer can view the image and color of the product, view the quantity of the product in the basket and information about the prices of the product. The page also allows the user to delete the product, if as such he deems it necessary. Also at the bottom of the page cart.html there are two indicators; the total number of products added and their total price.

4. Item (item.html)

You can go to the product page only by clicking on the more details button. Users can view the image at an enlarged scale, read the product description and information about the prices of goods. Using localStorage on the page, you can also add items to the shopping cart.
